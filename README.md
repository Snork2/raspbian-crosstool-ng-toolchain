This repository is to be used with crosstool-ng to generate a gcc toolchain to crosscompile to
the raspberry pi (optionnaly using a raspbian chroot as the sysroot)

* `.config` is the crosstool-ng configuration
* `raspberrypi-cross-toolchain.cmake` is the cmake toolchain file to use the generated toolchain
